Freescale imx GPC bindings

Optional properties:
- fsl,cpu_pupscr_sw2iso: for powering up CPU, number of 32K clock cycle PGC will wait before negating isolation signal.
- fsl,cpu_pupscr_sw: for powering up CPU, number of 32K clock cycle PGC will wait before asserting isolation signal.
- fsl,cpu_pdnscr_iso2sw: for powering down CPU, number of ipg clock cycle PGC will wait before negating isolation signal.
- fsl,cpu_pdnscr_iso: for powering down CPU, number of ipg clock cycle PGC will wait before asserting isolation signal.

These properties are for adjusting the GPC PGC CPU power up/down setting, if there is no such property in dts, then default
value in GPC PGC registers will be used.

- fsl,mf-mix-wakeup-irq: for recording those wakeup sources' irq number in fast/mega mix domain, same as GPC_IMRx register layout.
If the bitmap in this properties is 1, then fast/mega mix's power can NOT be gated if it is set as wakeup source in kernel.

Example:

	gpc: gpc@020dc000 {
		fsl,mf-mix-wakeup-irq = <0x4000000 0x3d00 0x0 0x0>;
	};

	&gpc {
		fsl,cpu_pupscr_sw2iso = <0xf>;
		fsl,cpu_pupscr_sw = <0xf>;
		fsl,cpu_pdnscr_iso2sw = <0x1>;
		fsl,cpu_pdnscr_iso = <0x1>;
	};
