* Amazon Dummy GPIO Controller
* This device emulates a card detect gpio for an mmc sdio card. This is useful in
* cases where platform does not have a spare gpio for card detection or the card
* itself is non-removable. It emulates a single gpio bank with a single line and
* an irq controller with a single irq assigned to the corresponding gpio.

Required properties:
-compatible : Should be "amazon,dummy_cd"
-emul-cd-gpio : some other gpio such as power gpio that can be used
		to detect card presence
- gpio-controller : Marks the device node as a gpio controller.
- #gpio-cells : Should be zero since we emulate just one dummy gpio
- interrupt-controller: Marks the device node as an interrupt controller.

Example:

gpio_cd: gpio-dummy-cd {
	compatible = "amazon,dummy_cd";
	/* Emulate dummy cd based on on/off gpio */
	emul-cd-gpio = <&gpio2 18 0>;
	gpio-controller;
	#gpio-cells = <0>;
	interrupt-controller;
};
