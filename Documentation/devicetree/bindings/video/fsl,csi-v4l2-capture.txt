* Freescale CMOS Sensor Interface (CSI) V4L2 Capture

Required properties for CSI
- compatible: "fsl,<soc>-csi". Supported chip includes imx6sl
- reg: Address and length of the register set for CSI
- interrupts: Should contain CSI interrupts

Required properties for v4l2_capture
- compatible: should be "fsl,<soc>-csi-v4l2", supported socs include imx6sl

Required properties for sensor
- compatible:  "<vendor>,<sensor>"
  please check the supported sensor in the Supported Sensor fields.
- reg: sensor I2C slave address
- pinctrl-names: should be "default" for parallel sensor
- pinctrl-0: should depend on the connection between sensor and i.MX
  connection between sensor and i.MX could be only legacy parallel on i.MX6SL
- clocks: should be the clock source provided to sensor.
- clock-names: should be "csi_mclk"
- AVDD-supply: set according to the board.
- DVDD-supply: set according to the board.
- pwn-gpios: set according to the board.
- rst-gpios: set according to the board.
- csi_id: csi id for v4l2 capture device
  should be 0 for i.MX6SL
- mclk: should the value of mclk clock send out the sensor. unit is Hz.
- mclk_source: should be 0 for i.MX6SL

Supported Sensor
- ovti, ov5640

Example for CSI:
	csi: csi@020e4000 {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6sl-csi";
		reg = <0x020e4000 0x4000>;
		interrupts = <0 7 0x04>;
		status = "disabled";
	};

Examples for v4l2_capture:
	csi_v4l2_cap {
		compatible = "fsl,imx6q-v4l2-capture";
		status = "okay";
	};

Examples for sensors:
	ov564x: ov564x@3c {
		compatible = "ovti,ov564x";
		reg = <0x3c>;
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_csi_0>;
		clocks = <&clks IMX6SL_CLK_CSI>;
		clock-names = "csi_mclk";
		AVDD-supply = <&vgen6_reg>;  /* 2.8v */
		DVDD-supply = <&vgen2_reg>;  /* 1.5v*/
		pwn-gpios = <&gpio1 25 1>;
		rst-gpios = <&gpio1 26 0>;
		csi_id = <0>;
		mclk = <24000000>;
		mclk_source = <0>;
	};
